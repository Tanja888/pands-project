## Analysis of Fisher's Iris data set using Python 
For the purpose of this project we used the multivariate Iris flower data set commonly used in statistical analysis and machine learning, also described as ["Hello World for data science"][1]. 

This data set was first collected by botanist E. Anderson and used for linear discriminant analysis of three species of the flower by biologist and statistician [R.A. Fisher in 1936.][2] Data set was taken from [UCI Machine Learning Repository.][3]

*Iris setosa is linearly seperable from Iris virginica and Iris versicolor.[4]
*summary

## Data 
Iris data set includes three classes: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor and Iris Virginica with 4 attributes measured in centimeters: sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. The total number of instances is 150.

## Technologies
Python 3.9.7

## Setup
To run a code 3 libraries are needed
```python
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
```

## To-do - I divided the project into these tasks:
- [ ] about Fisher's Iris data set
- [ ] import data and try to run some statistics
- [ ] export analysis to text file
- [ ] create histograms
- [ ] create scatter plot
- [ ] conclusions 
- [ ] make a nice readme and add references
